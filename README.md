# SERP crawler
this code helps us to scrape the youtube channel url from any search quiries in google search
beautiful soup is and amazingly robust library for webscraping. here the task was to scrape the youtube channel links from a google search page.I have done this as assessment for an internship from an amazing organization.
the search result page consist of many kind of list ie, links of channels, watch links, hashtags etc. the whole technique is quiet simple. we just have to get into inspect mode of the html page find required class and parse it to beautiful soup after getting response for request.
